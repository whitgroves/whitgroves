## Hello World!
These are the personal projects I've been working on over the last few years. Some, (like [q3](https://github.com/whitgroves/q3) and [fintech-bootcamp-at-home](https://github.com/whitgroves/fintech-bootcamp-at-home)) are meant solely to showcase knowledge, while others ([clique-ml](https://github.com/whitgroves/clique-ml), [solidity-contracts](https://github.com/whitgroves/solidity-contracts), and [gamekit](https://github.com/whitgroves/gamekit)) are public libraries meant for practical use.

If you find any of these useful, spot a bug that I missed, or are looking to hire a fullstack developer, please reach out via [email](mailto:whitney.groves@gmail.com) or [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/whitgroves).
